=== Area 26 ===

In area 25 to the south, the players encounter Lesso, cornered by three giant rats. 
He is in bad shape and strangely is fighting alongside a smaller goblin, named "gilly". Despite
the assistance, they are being overpowered. If the players help the duo and 
slay the rats, Lesso immediately attacks the goblin (These kobolds are not fans
of goblins under any circumstance) but the goblin simply cries out, rather than attacking.
Gilly says, in goblin, "Wait, wait! Please I don't mean you harm!" Erky understands his cries
and calls to Lesso to stop his attack. Lesso does not relent unless the players remove him from
his tussle. If the players engage Gilly in conversation, he speaks in broken common.

Gilly's Knowledge:
    * Gilly has come to ask the players assistance, secretly. Gilly belongs to a 
      small group of goblins, led by the advisor to the chief ("Grenl"), who love 
      their tribe and want only for an exit from this awful place. However, the Durbuluk
      tribe's control has recently been usurped by Durnn, a hobgoblin, and three of his cohorts.

    * Grenl and Gilly wish for the party to kill or drive Durnn out of tribe, so that Grenl can
      control the tribe, and lead them out of the citadel, if the Durbuluk tribe wishes it.

    * Gilly tells the party of back entrance to the Hall of the Goblin Chief, a door on the
      Northern wall of hazy, smoky hall West of the shooting range (area 39). Through that door is
      an unused hall which will give the party the advantage of surprise when entering the Chief's 
      quarters, and allow them to bypass Goblinville and the commotion that would cause. 

    * Gilly also knows that there is a well in the Chief's quarters, which leads down below, 
      and from which Belik occasionally emerges to converse with Durnn.

    * If the players attack Durnn, Grenl will not assist them until Durnn falls, fearing reprisal
      should the party fail. If Durnn falls however Grenl will turn on the remaining hobgoblins.
      She is proficient in tribal hexes and capable in a fight. 

After this, Calcryx begins to get restless. With a calming word from Cenarius, she will quiet momentarily,
but will insist on the party's promise being fulfilled soon, and she be freed. If the players choose to
ignore her chiding, she will attempt to break away and escape herself.
