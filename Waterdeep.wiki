=== City of Splendors ===

The city of Waterdeep lies on the mid-Western coast of [[Ganice]], and is the 
continent's largest city.  Founded around 300 years ago my the first 
adventurers and merchant's seeking their fortune at the advent of the Age 
of Expansion, it quickly abandoned the old customs and methods of 
governance of [[Uralt]].

The City of Waterdeep is divided into several Wards, once walled from each other
as semi-autonomous city-states. These walls have fallen with time and with the
unification of the city by the Masked Council, however two wards remain walled
and guarded: City of the Dead, and Cathedral Ward.

==== The Wards ====
* Castle Ward
    - Traditionally the domain of the wealthy and powerful in Waterdeep.
    - Makes up the westernmost part of the city, along with Cathedral Ward to
      the North. Its Western border follows the curvature of the towering Mt.
      Waterdeep, which itself extends to the coast of Ganice.
    - The Yawning Portal, a tavern known to adventurers, sits just a ways up
      the base of Mt. Waterdeep, atop the only know entrance to the
      [[Undermountain]].
    - Castle Wards is home to the city's administrative buildings and buildings
      of governance. The southern portion of Castle Ward containing these
      buildings, along with Dock Ward, form the oldest section of Waterdeep. 
    - The central section of Waterdeep is comprised by the Grand Bazaar, a city
      in itself made up of shops and stall offering an endless variety of
      scents, sights, and both magical and mundane products. 
    - Wealthy residential space makes up the ward's Northern crest.

* Dock Ward
    - The Dock Ward is the city's oldest area, having been the landing
      sight of the first settlers of Ganice. The city expanded from there, 
    - From the Deepwater Port inward, the Ward is split between housing,
      hospitality (inns, taverns, betting houses), and a small amount of
      shopping.
