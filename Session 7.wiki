=== Wrapping up in Oakhurst ===
As the players move to leave Oakhurst, they are approached by an unusually dressed pair.

Natalia and Nikola Shenova
 * !notRomanian brother and sister, speak with Russian-ish accents.
 * Dressed in somewhat tattered fine clothing with some leather adornments added for protection.
 
  ==== Natalia Chenova ====
  * The older of the two siblings, in her mid twenties.
  * In speaking to her, you get the sense that she is constantly engaged in this plan or that.
  * Natalia wears a navy blue military shirt, with gilded straps and tassels. Were it in better
   shape, you might mistake her for a general leading troops to war. She wears riding boots. Her 
   face is soft but certain, a face which evokes loyalty from those around her.
  * Refers to Nikola as Nikki, or as 
   
   
  ==== Nikola Chenova ====
  * Nikola wears a white collared shirt underneath a peat-colored leather vest, in turn underneath a
    thicker leather jacket.
  * Looks to be around 18, with a bright face and large personality. Loves his sister more than
    anything else, with excitement and money trailing close behind.
  * Refers to Natalia exclusively as "Sura" (Sister in !notRomanian) or "Iubi" (love in !notRomanian)
